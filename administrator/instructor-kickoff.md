* Set expectations for attendees
  * This is targeted towards engineers who don’t have OCP or KubeVirt experience.  If they have a lot of OCP, this will be some review.  The goal is to show them how to run KubeVirt locally and get a bit familiar with it.
* Temp check
  *  How many have used OpenShift?
  *  How many have used KubeVirt?
* Cover Requirements
  *  Laptop with a modern browser for OCP console
  *  SSH client
  *  Smartphones and tablets are not really useful.
  *  We don’t have a windows .ppk key for putty, but can make one if they have a windows box.
* Explain the environment
  *  One dedicated VM on GCP, they don’t need to know GCP.  Only log into the instance
* Let them know that this is the first time this lab has been given, there will be some bumps and bruises, we’ll capture notes on it and be sure to improve it.
* Explain what will be covered here:
  *  Deployed OCP with oc cluster up
  *  Explored the environment and some basic OpenShift commands
  *  Deployed an application on OpenShift
  *  Deployed and explored KubeVirt
  *  Explored OCP web console
  *  Deployed a virtual machine on OCP
  *  Accessed the virtual machine
  *  Deployed CDI
  *  Deployed APB
* This is a self paced lab, not instructor interrupt driven
*  They have 2 hours
* If they don’t get through it all, we can leave the VM up for them or spin one up for them later
* Take away: for you to be able to run through this yourself.  All scripts are on Github.
* Share out the URL for the github repo
  *  https://<URL to lab>/cnvlab (points to github repo, if this is easier, I dunno)
* We can redeliver this at anytime, spread the word.
* Assign student IDs
* Turn them loose, start the lab
* Check in on the students after 10 minutes to make sure everyone got logged in.
